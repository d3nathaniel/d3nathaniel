👋 Hi, I’m Nathaniel Hall ([@d3nathaniel](https://github.com/d3nathaniel))  
👀 I’m interested in Web3 development, DeFi, blockchain infrastructure, and open-source ecosystems.  
🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain fundamentals, smart contract development, and the Cosmos SDK to build interoperable dApps.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web3 projects, especially those related to DeFi protocols, Cosmos modules, and DAOs.  
📫 How to reach me: [@d3nathaniel on Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3nathaniel)
😄 Pronouns: he/him  
⚡ Fun fact: I once built a fully on-chain game with zero frontend — just smart contracts and command-line interaction!
